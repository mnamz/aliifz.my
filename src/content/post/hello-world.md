Welcome to my blog. I'm Aliif.

I spend my days connecting systems that don't want to talk to each other. But this isn't a work blog. I'm more interested in how ideas connect than how APIs do.


## What to expect

I write whatever's on my mind:

- **System thinking** - patterns I notice in tech or life.
- **Learning in general** - how juggling work as a student can drive me crazy while working full-time job
- **About human** - what makes people "people"
- **Random connection** - fragrances, fashion, formula 1, actually... I can't think of something else now but more to go!

If any of that interests you, stick around. More posts coming soon.
